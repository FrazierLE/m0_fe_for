# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I am still getting the hang of it, but I feel way more confident about it after class 4 and then practicing afterwards.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
At first I was overwhelmed, but as class progressed and we broke out into the navigator/driver exercises and Kim explained it more, I feel a lot better about `for` statements. I feel like I struggled way less than I expected and finished this assignment fairly quickly after applying what I learned in class.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I have adjusted my calendar to make sure I have time to study, but I need to continue to practice and go over lessons we have done already just to help solidify what I've learned.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Currently, I think I am okay on questions but I am sure while I'm going through the other assignments/doing practice problems, I'll have questions. I can get the answers by googling, trial and error, and asking people questions.
